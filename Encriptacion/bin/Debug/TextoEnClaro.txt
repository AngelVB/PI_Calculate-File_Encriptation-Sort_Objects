Rails Installer (Windows)
Installing Rails on Windows used to be a real pain, but thanks to the efforts of the good
people at Engine Yard—especially Dr. Nic Williams and Wayne E. Seguin—installing
Rails and related software on Windows is now easy. If you are using Windows, go
to Rails Installer and download the Rails Installer executable and view the excellent
installation video. Double-click the executable and follow the instructions to install
Git (so you can skip Section 1.2.2), Ruby (skip Section 1.2.2), RubyGems (skip
Section 1.2.2), and Rails itself (skip Section 1.2.2). Once the installation has finished,
you can skip right to the creation of the first application in Section 1.2.3.
Bear in mind that the Rails Installer might use a slightly different version of Rails
from the one installed in Section 1.2.2, which might cause incompatibilities. To fix this,
I am currently working with Nic and Wayne to create a list of Rails Installers ordered
by Rails version number.
Install Git
Much of the Rails ecosystem depends in one way or another on a version control system
called Git (covered in more detail in Section 1.3). Because its use is ubiquitous, you
should install Git even at this early stage; I suggest following the installation instructions
for your platform at the Installing Git section of Pro Git.
Install Ruby
The next step is to install Ruby. It’s possible that your system already has it; try
running
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.9.3
to see the version number. Rails 3 requires Ruby 1.8.7 or later and works best with
Ruby 1.9.x. This tutorial assumes that most readers are using Ruby 1.9.2 or 1.9.3, but
Ruby 1.8.7 should work as well (although there is one syntax difference, covered in
Chapter 4, and assorted minor differences in output).
As part of installing Ruby, if you are using OS X or Linux, I strongly recommend
using Ruby Version Manager (RVM), which allows you to install and manage
multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine. (The Pik project accomplishes a
similar feat on Windows.) This is particularly important if you want to run different
